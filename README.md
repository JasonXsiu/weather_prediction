# Cloudy or not in Australia ?

## What is this ?
This is to create the best model that can predict if it is going to be cloudy tomorrow for 10 locations in Australia.


## Why you are doing it?
To compares different machine learning models and find the best one using R.

## The process of this modelling
1. Data Exploratory
2. Data pre-processing
3. Spilt the data into training and testing sets (70% and 30%)
4. Implement a classification models to predict the cloudiness:
• Decision Tree • Naïve Bayes • Bagging • Boosting • Random Forest 
5. Comparion based on confusion matrix and report the accuracy of each model
6. Comparion based on AUC
7. Choose the best model
8. Implement an Artificial Neural Network classifier and report its performance

## 
This dataset is a edited the Kaggle competition data: 
Predict next-day rain in Australia. https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package; but instead, this is to predict if the following day will be cloudy. 
The data contains a number of meteorological observations as attributes, and the class attribute “CloudTomorrow”. Details 
of the decision attributes please refer to the photo "DataDesc.png".
